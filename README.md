# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Introduction
This project employs a linear regression model to predict the price of cars based on various features from the provided dataset. The goal is to assist potential car buyers and sellers in making data-driven decisions regarding car pricing.

## Steps Taken

1. **Creating a Car-Price Prediction Project:**
   - Developed a comprehensive project focused on predicting car prices using linear regression.

2. **Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted EDA using Jupyter Notebooks to understand dataset characteristics and identify patterns.

3. **Setting Up a Validation Framework:**
   - Implemented a validation framework to evaluate model performance effectively.

4. **Implementing Linear Regression from Scratch:**
   - Built the linear regression model manually to gain deeper insights into the working mechanism.

5. **Simple Feature Engineering:**
   - Applied feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy and performance.

6. **Model Regularization:**
   - Implemented regularization techniques to control the model and prevent overfitting.

7. **Predicting Car Prices:**
   - Utilized the trained model to make predictions on car prices based on input features.
